Team Five loves ice cream. In fact, we love it so much, we are thinking about opening an ice cream store.  Although we all love ice cream, we don’t completely agree on what we think are potential customers like most about ice cream.
So, before starting our store, we have decided to create a blog that will allow of friends and family to post what the like and don’t like about ice cream.  This way we can better prepare to launch a successful ice cream store.


The Ice Cream Blog will allow users to post whatever they want about ice cream.  Once a post is submitted, other members can add comments about each post.
The blog will be limited to friends and family so people will have to log in to be allowed to post or see posts.
The application will store posts, comments, and log-in information.  It will also allow users to only see the posts they personally posted.
